2018-10-xx v1.2 “rTorrent 0.9.7”
--------------------------------

.. rubric:: UNRELEASED DEVELOPMENT VERSION

- UI: Added item search via ``Ctrl-F`` and ``Shift-F`` / ``F3``
- UI: Added *no data* indicator to alerts (in the ``❢`` column)
- UI: Replaced problematic glyphs like ‘hourglass’ (caused visual defects on *Stretch* and *Bionic*)
- Command: Added ``string.shorten`` command (for logging)
- Fix: Compilation on 32bit platforms (issue #108)
- Docker: Demo launcher renamed to ``launch-rt-ps-demo.sh``,
  and supports any distro with a package available for it


2018-07-01 v1.1 “Design Your Canvas”
------------------------------------

This release adds the new fully customizable and responsive *canvas v2*,
and many new configuration and XMLRPC commands plus a few fixes
– see below for a full list of changes.
It comes with complete documentation hosted on *Read the Docs* and built with *Sphinx*.
Binary builds for *Debian* and *Ubuntu* are available as DEB packages on *Bintray*.

Note that *rTorrent-PS* is based on the *stable* release of *rTorrent*,
and that is still version 0.9.6 at the time of this release.
Many of the features and commands in version 0.9.7 are originally developed in
or otherwise back-ported to this project anyway.

Read the related :ref:`upgrade-to-0.6.x` instructions,
which will update configuration snippets in the ``rtorrent.d`` directories.
If you used those snippets before, their update is **required** to run the new version
– else you'll get visual defects at the very minimum,
but worse stuff might happen.

If you do not have a ``~/rtorrent/rtorrent.d`` directory created by the helper scripts,
then you just have to know yourself what to do (i.e. browse through ``git`` diffs)
– those scripts can only handle standard situations and setups.
