How to Get Support Efficiently?
===============================

To resolve any problems with or questions about your configuration
and software installation, there are several ways that you should try
from top to bottom:

#. *Always* look into the “Troubleshooting Guide” of the manual as a first measure,
   which is often the fastest way to get back to a working system.
   That guide also explains how to efficiently report your problem
   when you cannot fix it yourself.
#. To get in contact with other users of `PyroScope`_ projects, join the
   `pyroscope-users`_ mailing list or the inofficial ``##rtorrent``
   channel on ``irc.freenode.net``.
#. *Do* add problems that are clearly a bug to the issue tracker on GitHub
   – however use the support channels above for questions about the documentation
   or use of the software.
